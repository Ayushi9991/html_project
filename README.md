# html_project
I created a project using HTML and CSS that showcases the 10 avatars (Dashavatara) of Lord Vishnu. The website includes detailed information about each avatar, along with images and a clean layout. This project helped me improve my skills in web design, styling, and creating responsive sections using CSS.
